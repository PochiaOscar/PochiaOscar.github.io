Weather: Sunny
Emotion: Not bad

## Idea
I was trying to sleep from 10pm last night. And as expected, I failed unfortunately. It was quite common that when I was trying to sleep earlier like 11pm ish, I felt so frightened when everything goes silent. Then I turned to my iPad or iPhone to find some comfort. As the result, I fell asleep late.
It is true that you need TRAINING for going to sleep regularly.
