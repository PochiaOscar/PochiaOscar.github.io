## Idea
I was trying to sleep from 10pm last night. And as expected, I failed unfortunately. It was quite common that when I was trying to sleep earlier like 11pm ish, I felt so frightened when everything goes silent. Then I turned to my iPad or iPhone to find some comfort. As the result, I fell asleep late.
It is true that you need TRAINING for going to sleep regularly.

## TODO
1. Fill the rest of code. Make sure serializer and model work well in view.py
2. Mount SQL data in container. And how to filter the data in database.
3. Check gis-related Django packages. What Django can do with GIS type data?
4. Run the test with local code.
5. Deploy web campus in docker container
6. Check how to connect 2 containers.
7. How to filter the target data?
